# Slot Machine Game

Hello!
This is a simple slot machine game implemented in Python. The player deposits money, chooses the number of lines to bet on, and places a bet per line. The game then spins the slot machine and calculates winnings based on the symbols that appear.

It is based on a tutorial from [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim).

**Step 2**: The user selects the number of lines to bet on (max is set to 3) and the amount of money she/he wants to bet per line.

**Step 3**: The game checks if there are any winning combinations on the bet lines and calculates the winnings.

**Step 4**: The player can either choose to continue playing or quit.
